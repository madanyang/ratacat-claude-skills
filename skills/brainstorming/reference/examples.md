# Brainstorming Examples

## Example: AI Code Review Tools

This example shows how to use the brainstorming skill to refine a vague idea into a concrete blog post angle.

```
You: I want to write about code reviews

AI: [invokes brainstorming skill]
    What aspect of code reviews? Process, tooling, culture?

You: How AI code review tools miss important stuff

AI: Interesting - what do they miss that humans catch?

You: Context, design decisions, why code exists

AI: So it's not about finding bugs, but understanding intent?
    Have you seen this happen in practice?

You: Yes, at my current company - AI flags style but misses architecture issues

AI: That's concrete. Are you arguing:
    (1) AI tools are fundamentally limited, or
    (2) Current tools need better context, or
    (3) Humans and AI serve different purposes?

You: Probably #3 - they're complementary

AI: Good angle - avoids being anti-AI while still critical.

    Should we outline this? Thinking:
    1. The Promise (what AI code review claims to do)
    2. What It Misses (context, intent, architecture)
    3. What Humans Still Do Better
    4. How to Use Both Together

You: Yes, but add why this matters

AI: [adds to outline in braindump.md]
    Added "Why This Matters" section - practical implications
    for engineering teams. Ready to start drafting?

## What This Example Demonstrates

**Techniques Used:**
- Started with questions, not suggestions
- Explored the specific angle (not all aspects of code reviews)
- Challenged assumptions ("is it about bugs or intent?")
- Grounded in concrete experience (current company)
- Offered multiple perspectives (3 different angles)
- Transitioned only when ready (clear argument, examples, outline)

**Braindump Updates:**
- Context: Experience at current company with AI code review
- Core Argument: AI and human code review are complementary, not competitive
- Audience: Engineering teams using or considering AI code review tools
- Outline: 4 main sections identified

**Signs of Readiness:**
- Core argument clear (complementary, not competitive)
- Concrete example identified (company experience)
- User expressed confidence in direction
- Outline emerged naturally from conversation
